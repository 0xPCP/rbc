# Developer Guide — Cycling Clubs Platform

## What this is

A multi-tenant cycling club platform. Any cycling club can host a club page, publish a ride calendar, and manage members. Riders register once and see all their rides across every joined club on a single home screen.

## App factory

`create_app(config_class=Config)` in `app/__init__.py`:

1. Initialises Flask extensions (db, bcrypt, login_manager, csrf, mail)
2. Registers all blueprints
3. Registers a `strftime` Jinja2 filter (cross-platform — swaps `%-d` to `%#d` on Windows)
4. Injects `now` and `version` into every template via context processor
5. Calls `init_scheduler(app)` unless `TESTING=True`

---

## Database models

All models live in `app/models.py`. SQLAlchemy 2.x ORM with legacy query API.

### User

Central account. One user can be a member of many clubs and an admin of many clubs.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | Integer PK | |
| username | String 50, unique | |
| email | String 255, unique | used for login + all email |
| password_hash | String 255 | bcrypt |
| is_admin | Boolean | global superadmin flag |
| created_at | DateTime UTC | |
| address, zip_code | String | for weather widget |
| lat, lng | Float | geocoded from zip_code |
| emergency_contact_name/phone | String | opt-in; shown to ride admins on roster |
| gear_inventory | JSON | list of item IDs from GEAR_CATALOG |
| strava_id | BigInteger unique | nullable |
| strava_access_token / refresh_token | Text | nullable |
| strava_token_expires_at | Integer | unix timestamp |

**Key methods:**

```python
user.is_club_admin(club)        # full admin or superadmin
user.is_ride_manager(club)      # ride_manager role
user.can_manage_rides(club)     # admin OR ride_manager
user.is_active_member_of(club)  # status='active' membership
user.is_pending_member_of(club) # status='pending'
user.is_content_editor(club)    # content_editor role
user.is_treasurer(club)         # treasurer role
user.can_manage_content(club)   # admin OR content_editor
user.can_view_members(club)     # admin OR treasurer
user.has_signed_waiver(club, year=None)  # waiver check for given year
```

---

### Club

One row per club. `slug` is the URL identifier (e.g., `rbc` → `/clubs/rbc/`).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | Integer PK | |
| slug | String 80, unique | URL-safe; set at creation |
| name | String 200 | |
| description | Text | |
| logo_url, website, contact_email | String | |
| address, city, state, zip_code | String | |
| lat, lng | Float | geocoded |
| is_active | Boolean | inactive clubs hidden from directory |
| theme_primary, theme_accent | String hex | e.g., `#2d6a4f` |
| banner_url | String | header background image |
| is_private | Boolean | hides route URL, GPX, media, comments from non-members |
| require_membership | Boolean | gates ride signups behind active membership |
| join_approval | String | `'auto'` or `'manual'` |
| strava_club_id | BigInteger | optional; enables club activity feed |
| auto_cancel_enabled | Boolean | turns on weather auto-cancel |
| cancel_rain_prob | Integer | % precip probability threshold |
| cancel_wind_mph | Integer | wind speed threshold |
| cancel_temp_min_f / max_f | Integer | temperature range thresholds |

**Key properties:**

```python
club.member_count    # count of active ClubMembership rows
club.current_waiver  # most recently created ClubWaiver
```

---

### ClubMembership

Junction between User and Club with a status.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| user_id, club_id | FK; unique together |
| status | `'active'` or `'pending'` |
| joined_at | DateTime UTC |

**Flows:**
- `join_approval='auto'` → status set to `'active'` immediately on join
- `join_approval='manual'` → status set to `'pending'`; admin approves via team page
- Approval sends `send_membership_approved()` email
- Rejection deletes the row and sends `send_membership_rejected()` email

---

### ClubAdmin

Grants a user an admin role within a specific club.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| user_id, club_id | FK; unique together |
| role | `'admin'` \| `'ride_manager'` \| `'content_editor'` \| `'treasurer'` |

**Role capabilities:**

| Role | Rides | Members | Content | Settings | Financial |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| ride_manager | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| content_editor | — | — | ✓ | — | — |
| treasurer | — | view only | — | — | ✓ |

Global `is_admin` users bypass all role checks.

---

### Ride

One row per ride occurrence. Recurring rides have both a template row and instance rows.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| club_id | FK to Club |
| title, date, time | |
| meeting_location | String 500 |
| distance_miles, elevation_feet | Float/Integer |
| pace_category | `'A'` \| `'B'` \| `'C'` \| `'D'` |
| ride_type | `'road'` \| `'gravel'` \| `'social'` \| `'training'` \| `'event'` \| `'night'` |
| leader_id | FK to User (nullable) |
| ride_leader | String — denormalised display name |
| route_url | RideWithGPS or other URL |
| video_url | YouTube/Vimeo URL |
| max_riders | Integer (nullable = unlimited) |
| is_cancelled, cancel_reason | Boolean + String |
| is_recurring | True on template rows |
| recurrence_parent_id | FK to parent Ride (on instance rows) |

**Key computed properties:**

```python
ride.signup_count       # non-waitlist signups
ride.waitlist_count
ride.is_full            # signup_count >= max_riders (if set)
ride.spots_remaining    # max_riders - signup_count

# RideWithGPS parsing (extracts route ID from URL)
ride.ridewithgps_route_id
ride.ridewithgps_embed_url
ride.ridewithgps_map_image_url

# Video embed
ride.embed_url          # YouTube or Vimeo iframe src

ride.pace_label         # e.g., "A — Fast (22+ mph)"
```

---

### RideSignup

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| ride_id, user_id | FK; unique together |
| is_waitlist | True = on waitlist |
| attended | `None` = not recorded; `True` = showed up; `False` = no-show |

When a signup is deleted (unsignup), the scheduler auto-promotes the first waitlist entry to confirmed and sends `send_waitlist_promoted()`.

---

### RideMedia

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| media_type | `'photo'` or `'video_link'` |
| file_path | relative path under UPLOAD_FOLDER for photos |
| url | external video URL |
| caption | String 300 |

`embed_url` property extracts YouTube/Vimeo iframe src from `url` via regex.

Only shown when `ride.date <= today`. Private club photos served through Flask with membership check.

---

### RideComment

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| ride_id, user_id | FK |
| body | Text |

Members can delete their own. Admins/ride_managers can delete any.

---

### ClubInvite

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| club_id, created_by | FK |
| email | invite target address |
| token | 64-char URL-safe unique string |
| expires_at | 7 days from creation |
| used_at, used_by_user_id | set on redemption |

Claim route: `/clubs/invites/<token>`. Redirects to login if unauthenticated. On redeem, creates or upgrades a ClubMembership to `'active'`.

---

### ClubWaiver / WaiverSignature

Each club can have one waiver per year. Riders must sign before their first ride signup of the year.

`user.has_signed_waiver(club)` checks for a WaiverSignature matching the current year.

## Permission decorators

Defined in `app/routes/admin.py`:

```python
@club_admin_required         # ClubAdmin.role='admin' or User.is_admin
@club_ride_admin_required    # role in ('admin','ride_manager') or is_admin
@club_content_required       # role in ('admin','content_editor') or is_admin
@club_member_view_required   # role in ('admin','treasurer') or is_admin
@superadmin_required         # User.is_admin only
```

All decorators abort 403 immediately if the user is unauthenticated.

---

## Key application flows

### New user signup
1. POST `/auth/register` → hashes password → creates `User`
2. If zip_code provided, `geocode_zip()` populates lat/lng
3. First user created becomes `is_admin=True`

### Joining a club
1. POST `/clubs/<slug>/join`
2. If `club.join_approval == 'auto'` → `ClubMembership(status='active')`
3. If `club.join_approval == 'manual'` → `ClubMembership(status='pending')`; admin sees badge on dashboard
4. Admin approves via team page → status → `'active'` + approval email sent

### Signing up for a ride
1. POST `/clubs/<slug>/rides/<id>/signup`
2. Checks: user logged in → active membership (if `require_membership`) → waiver signed this year → ride not cancelled → not already signed up
3. If `ride.is_full` → `RideSignup(is_waitlist=True)`
4. Otherwise → `RideSignup(is_waitlist=False)`
5. If ride was just created and `new_ride_notification` sent → see email section

### Waiver gate
- `user.has_signed_waiver(club)` checks for `WaiverSignature(user_id, club_id, year=current_year)`
- If missing, signup route redirects to `/clubs/<slug>/waiver`
- After signing, redirect returns to the original ride

### Recurring rides
- Admin checks "Repeat weekly" on ride form
- On save: `generate_instances(ride, weeks=8)` creates 8 copies with `recurrence_parent_id` set
- On edit of template: `delete_future_instances(template)` then `generate_instances()` again
- Instances are independent rides — editing one instance does not affect others

### Weather auto-cancel (scheduler)
1. `check_auto_cancels()` runs at 6:00 AM daily
2. For each active club with `auto_cancel_enabled=True`: fetch rides for today, get weather
3. If any threshold exceeded (rain prob, wind, temp): mark `is_cancelled=True`, set `cancel_reason`, send cancellation emails
4. `send_reminders()` runs at 6:15 AM: sends morning-of reminders to signups for today's rides

### Post-ride media
- Upload forms only appear and accept submissions when `ride.date <= today`
- Photos: validated extension → Pillow resize to `MEDIA_MAX_WIDTH_PX` px wide → JPEG 85% quality → stored in `UPLOAD_FOLDER/ride_media/<ride_id>/<uuid>.jpg`
- Videos: URL stored as-is; `embed_url` property extracts YouTube/Vimeo iframe src
- `purge_expired_media()` runs nightly at 2:30 AM and deletes files + DB rows for rides older than `MEDIA_EXPIRY_DAYS`

---

---

## Scheduled jobs

Managed by APScheduler `BackgroundScheduler`. Initialised in `init_scheduler(app)` which is called by the app factory (skipped when `TESTING=True`).

| Job | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `check_auto_cancels` | Daily at `AUTO_CANCEL_HOUR` (default 6 AM) | Cancels today's rides that breach weather thresholds; sends cancellation emails |
| `send_reminders` | Daily at `AUTO_CANCEL_HOUR + 0:15` | Sends morning-of reminder emails to all signups for today's rides |
| `send_weekly_digests` | Sundays at 7 AM | Emails each active member a digest of the next 7 days of rides |
| `purge_expired_media` | Daily at 2:30 AM | Deletes photo files + DB rows for rides older than `MEDIA_EXPIRY_DAYS` |

---

## Email system

All functions in `app/email.py`. Each is fire-and-forget (errors logged, never raised). If `MAIL_SERVER` is empty, `MAIL_SUPPRESS_SEND=True` is set and no messages are sent.

| Function | Trigger | Recipients |
|---|---|---|
| `send_cancellation_emails(ride)` | auto-cancel or manual cancel | all non-waitlist signups |
| `send_ride_reminder(ride)` | scheduler, morning of ride | all non-waitlist signups |
| `send_new_ride_notification(ride)` | admin creates a new ride | all active members |
| `send_waitlist_promoted(signup)` | unsignup frees a slot | promoted rider |
| `send_membership_approved(user, club)` | admin approves pending | joining user |
| `send_membership_rejected(user, club)` | admin rejects pending | joining user |
| `send_invite_email(invite)` | admin sends invite | invite.email address |
| `send_weekly_digest(club, rides)` | Sunday scheduler | all active members of club |

HTML and plain-text variants exist for all transactional emails under `app/templates/email/`.

---

## Weather integration

`app/weather.py` — calls Open-Meteo (no API key, rate-limit friendly).

- `get_weather_for_rides(rides)` — fetches forecasts for rides within the next 14 days; returns `{ride.id: weather_dict}`. Rides beyond 14 days get no forecast.
- `get_current_weather(lat, lng)` — single-point current conditions; cached 15 min per location.
- Responses include: `temp_f`, `feels_like_f`, `wind_mph`, `precip_prob`, `description`, `emoji`, `severity` (0/1/2), `warning` (bool), `warning_reasons`.
- WMO weather codes 0–99 are mapped to descriptions + emoji.
- Cache: in-process dictionary, keyed by `(lat, lng)`, TTL 30 min for forecasts.

---

## Geocoding

`app/geocoding.py` — calls OpenStreetMap Nominatim.

- `geocode_zip(zip_code)` → `(lat, lng)` or `None` (requires User-Agent header)
- `haversine_miles(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)` → float distance
- `clubs_near_zip(zip_code, clubs, radius_miles=50)` → `[(club, distance_miles), ...]` sorted by distance; used by club directory and ride discovery

---

## Theming

Per-club color scheme. `app/utils.py` provides `club_theme_vars(club)` which returns a CSS variable block. Injected into club pages via `{% include 'clubs/_theme.html' %}`.

6 preset color schemes: forest, ocean, slate, sunset, crimson, desert. Custom mode uses hex color pickers. Admin settings page has a live preview card.

CSS variables: `--rbc-green` (primary), `--rbc-green-dark`, `--rbc-green-light`, `--rbc-green-pale`, `--rbc-accent`.

---

## Dev/deploy workflow

1. Implement feature in `D:\Projects\rbc\`
2. Add/update tests in `tests/`
3. Run `pytest --ignore=tests/test_browser_mobile.py` — all must pass
4. Bump `app/version.py`
5. `git add` specific files, `git commit`, `git push origin master`
6. Robocopy to TrueNAS (excludes `.git`, `__pycache__`, `instance`, `uploads`, `*.pyc`, `*.db`):
   ```powershell
   robocopy D:\Projects\rbc \\192.168.50.189\docker\projects\rbc /MIR /XD .git __pycache__ instance uploads /XF *.pyc *.db
   ```
7. SSH and rebuild + force-recreate:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/fast/docker/projects/rbc
   docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate web
   ```
8. If schema changed, re-seed dev DB:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python seed.py
   ```

**Important:** Always use `--force-recreate` on the web container. Without it, Docker Compose may skip restarting the container even after building a new image, leaving the old code running.

## Common gotchas

**WTForms BooleanField**: Treats any non-empty string (including `'0'`) as `True`. For boolean inputs driven by JS hidden fields, read directly: `request.form.get('field') == '1'`.

**SQLite vs PostgreSQL datetimes**: Tests use SQLite which strips timezone info. All datetime comparisons against stored values use `datetime.utcnow()` (naive), never `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (aware). Model defaults use `lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for correctness in production.

**`--force-recreate` on deploy**: `docker compose up -d --build` builds a new image but may not restart the running container. Always pass `--force-recreate web` to guarantee the new image is picked up.

**Schema migrations**: This project has no Alembic migration setup — schema changes are applied by running `seed.py` which does `db.drop_all()` + `db.create_all()`. This wipes all data. Not suitable for production with real user data — a proper migration system (Flask-Migrate / Alembic) should be added before public launch.

**Strava refresh tokens**: Club-level Strava feeds use a long-lived refresh token stored in `.env`. User-level tokens are short-lived and stored per-user in the DB.

**Cross-platform strftime**: Templates use `%-d` (Linux) for day-without-leading-zero. A `strftime` Jinja2 filter registered in `create_app()` swaps this to `%#d` on Windows so local test runs work correctly.
