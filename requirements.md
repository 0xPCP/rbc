# Cycling Clubs App — Requirements

## Vision

A multi-tenant web platform where any cycling club can host their presence, manage their ride calendar, and grow their membership. Users register once, join multiple clubs, and see all their upcoming rides in a single personalized home screen. The platform should make it effortless for a club admin to run a professional club without needing a separate website, payment processor, or email system.

Research across ~50 major US cycling clubs (NYCC, Cascade Bicycle Club, BTCNJ, DC Velo, Chicago Cycling Club, LA Wheelmen, Boulder Velo, etc.) and leading club management platforms (Cyql, RideWithGPS for Clubs, ClubExpress, RideStats) informed this requirements list.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- All third-party services (weather, maps) must be self-hostable or free/open — no paid API keys for core features
- Every feature ships with a pytest test harness; all tests must pass before commit
- Docker on TrueNAS Scale is the deployment target — `docker compose up -d --build`
- Multi-tenant from day one — club slugs are the isolation boundary
- Mobile-responsive UI on all pages (Bootstrap 5, tested at 390px width)
- No JavaScript framework dependency — server-rendered Jinja2 + vanilla JS for interactive elements
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt; CSRF on all forms
